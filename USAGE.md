# Usage Guide

## Quick Start (Docker)

The fastest way to run truthcrawl is with Docker. A single command starts an
autonomous node that crawls, batches, timestamps, and syncs automatically.

```sh
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v truthcrawl-data:/data \
  rydickin/truthcrawl
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to see the node dashboard.

Keys are generated automatically on first run. Data persists in the
`truthcrawl-data` Docker volume.

### Adding URLs to crawl

The node reads URLs from a file called `urls.txt` inside the data directory.
With a Docker volume:

```sh
docker exec -it <container-id> sh -c 'echo "https://example.com" >> /data/urls.txt'
```

Or mount a local directory instead of a named volume:

```sh
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ~/truthcrawl-data:/data \
  rydickin/truthcrawl
```

Then edit `~/truthcrawl-data/urls.txt` directly. One URL per line, `#` for
comments:

```
# Sites to crawl
https://example.com
https://news.ycombinator.com
```

The node fetches each listed URL once per hour by default and records what it
sees. This is a single-page fetcher, not a full web crawler -- it does not
spider sites, discover new pages, or follow links. It also does not currently
check robots.txt or enforce rate limits, so use responsibly.

## Quick Start (CLI)

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or later
- Maven 3.9+

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rndxdev/truthcrawl.git
cd truthcrawl
mvn package -pl truthcrawl-core,truthcrawl-cli -DskipTests
```

### Run the CLI

After building, run commands via:

```sh
java -cp "truthcrawl-core/target/*:truthcrawl-cli/target/*" \
  io.truthcrawl.cli.Main <command> [args...]
```

Create an alias for convenience:

```sh
alias truthcrawl='java -cp "truthcrawl-core/target/*:truthcrawl-cli/target/*" io.truthcrawl.cli.Main'
```

### Generate keys

```sh
truthcrawl gen-key ~/truthcrawl-data/keys
```

This creates `priv.key` and `pub.key` in the specified directory.

## Running a Node

### Autonomous node (recommended)

The `node` command runs everything automatically:

```sh
truthcrawl node [data-dir]
```

This starts:
- **HTTP server** on port 8080 (serves dashboard, records, batches, peer API)
- **Sync loop** that pulls new batches and records from registered peers
- **Crawl loop** that observes URLs listed in `data-dir/urls.txt`

`data-dir` defaults to `~/truthcrawl-data` (or the `TRUTHCRAWL_DATA`
environment variable).

### Configuration

Configure the node via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TRUTHCRAWL_DATA` | `~/truthcrawl-data` | Data directory path |
| `TRUTHCRAWL_PORT` | `8080` | HTTP server port |
| `TRUTHCRAWL_SYNC_INTERVAL` | `300` | Seconds between peer sync cycles |
| `TRUTHCRAWL_CRAWL_INTERVAL` | `3600` | Seconds between URL crawl cycles |

Docker example with custom config:

```sh
docker run -d \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  -e TRUTHCRAWL_PORT=9090 \
  -e TRUTHCRAWL_SYNC_INTERVAL=60 \
  -e TRUTHCRAWL_CRAWL_INTERVAL=1800 \
  -v truthcrawl-data:/data \
  rydickin/truthcrawl
```

### Data directory layout

The node creates and manages this structure:

```
truthcrawl-data/
  keys/
    priv.key              # Ed25519 private key
    pub.key               # Ed25519 public key
  store/
    ab/
      abcdef...1234.txt   # Observation records (sharded by hash prefix)
  batches/
    batch-2026-02-04-001/
      manifest.txt        # Record hashes in this batch
      chain-link.txt      # Merkle root + back-reference to previous batch
      signature.txt       # Publisher signature
  timestamps/
    abcdef...1234.txt     # Timestamp tokens (keyed by data hash)
  peers/
    abcdef...1234.txt     # Registered peer info
  profiles/
    abcdef...1234.txt     # Node identity profiles
  urls.txt                # URLs to auto-crawl (one per line)
```

## Multi-Node Setup

### On a local network

1. Start nodes on two machines. Find each machine's LAN IP:

   ```sh
   hostname -I
   ```

2. Register each node as a peer of the other. From node A:

   ```sh
   truthcrawl register-peer http://<node-B-ip>:8080 <node-B-pub-key> ~/truthcrawl-data/peers
   ```

   Get node B's public key from `http://<node-B-ip>:8080/info` or from its
   `pub.key` file.

3. Once peers are registered, the nodes sync automatically.

### Manual sync (one-time)

Pull all batches and records from a remote node without registering it as a
peer:

```sh
truthcrawl sync http://<remote-ip>:8080
```

Or with Docker:

```sh
docker exec <container-id> /app/truthcrawl sync http://<remote-ip>:8080
```

### Running a second node via Docker

On another machine:

```sh
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v truthcrawl-data:/data \
  rydickin/truthcrawl
```

Each node generates its own unique key pair and node ID on first run.

## Verification

Every claim in truthcrawl is independently verifiable. Given only the public
keys and the published data, any third party can:

1. **Verify a record** -- check the node's Ed25519 signature
2. **Verify a batch** -- recompute the Merkle root from the manifest and check the publisher signature
3. **Verify the chain** -- walk the batch chain and confirm each link references the previous root
4. **Verify a timestamp** -- check the TSA signature over the data hash and time

No trust in the node operator is required. Only math.
